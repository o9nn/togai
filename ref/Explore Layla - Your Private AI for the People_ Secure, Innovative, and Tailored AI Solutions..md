## Technology

### Advanced

Experience Layla, the innovative AI for the people, designed to provide private and secure AI solutions directly on your device. Unlike traditional AI systems, Layla ensures your data remains entirely under your control, offering advanced features such as personalized responses and seamless interaction. With AI for the people at its core, Layla continuously learns and adapts to your needs, delivering unparalleled convenience and functionality. Discover how Layla transforms AI accessibility and empowers your daily activities today.

At Layla, we are proud to introduce the world's first private AI. Unlike other AI systems that rely on cloud-based services, Layla resides directly on your device, ensuring your privacy and security. With Layla, you have full control over your personal data and can enjoy the benefits of AI without compromising your privacy.

Layla's advanced technology combines state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with natural language processing capabilities, allowing for seamless interaction and understanding. It continuously learns from your interactions and adapts to your preferences, ensuring that its responses are tailored specifically to you.

Here are a few additional aspects of Layla's technology that make it unique:

1\. Advanced Machine Learning: Layla's machine learning algorithms are constantly improving and adapting to provide you with more accurate and relevant responses over time.

2\. Natural Language Processing: Layla understands natural language, allowing you to communicate with it in a conversational manner, just as you would with another person.

3\. Contextual Understanding: Layla can interpret complex queries and understand the context of your requests, providing detailed and accurate responses.

4\. On-Device Processing: Layla's algorithms process data directly

on your device, ensuring fast and efficient performance. This eliminates the need for a stable internet connection and reduces reliance on external servers.

## WHAT ARE LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

Large Language Models (also known as LLMs) are amalgamations of amounts of data (text) over human history.

This includes:

- Literature - Shakespear, Hugo, Plato, and all the greats
- Github - programming, logic, reasoning
- ArXiv - research papers, cutting edge technology
- Wikipedia - general knowledge
- StackExchange - questions and answers

### WORDS & TOKENS

Text are represented as "tokens". Tokens can be anywhere from part of a word, to whole phrases. Layla predicts the next token based on existing conversation history, such as your queries, or previous chats.

The base model is trained on over 1.2 trillion Tokens.

### PERSONALITY & LEARNING

By adjusting specific parts of the neural network, Layla is able to imitate any personality on the planet.

Using the same method, Layla is able to learn new skills, remember your preferences, and provide better functionality to users.

## AGUMENTED FEATURES

By using the logic, reasoning, and knowledge of the base models, Layla can pick up satellite skills such as:

- Web browsing
- Article summarisation
- Tasks & reminders

Layla does this the same way a human learns new skills: by using existing knowledge and applying it to new fields.

### TENSORS

Tensors are the heart of the neural network. They are a structure of numbers that represent a neuron in our human brain. They work similarly: they learn by adjusting weights which in turn fires up different pathways in the network, resulting in different outputs.

### ALL THIS RUNS ON YOUR PHONE

Recently breakthroughs in consumer hardware now allows LLMs to be run on consumer hardware such as phones and tablets.

A.I. is now more accessible than ever.
