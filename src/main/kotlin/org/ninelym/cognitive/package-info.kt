/**
 * Cognitive Computing Core Package
 * 
 * Phase 1: Cognitive Primitives & Foundational Hypergraph Encoding
 * 
 * This package contains the foundational components for cognitive computing
 * within the 9mly application, implementing atomic vocabulary and bidirectional
 * translation between agentic kernel ML primitives and AtomSpace hypergraph patterns.
 * 
 * Key components:
 * - Hypergraph representation and manipulation
 * - Scheme-based cognitive grammar
 * - Tensor fragment architecture
 * - Verification and visualization utilities
 * 
 * Tensor signature: [modality, depth, context, salience, autonomy_index]
