## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

The Toga personality system is implemented in Python and integrates with:
- **Layla**: Character system, voice, animation, task automation
- **Neuro-Sama**: Cognitive framework, memory, reasoning, WebSocket protocol

### Basic Usage

```python
from python.helpers.toga_personality import initialize_toga_personality

# Initialize Himiko Toga personality
toga = initialize_toga_personality()

# Frame input through Toga's perspective
message = "This solution is so cute!"
framed = toga.frame_input(message)
print(framed)
# Output: "Ehehe~ ♡ This solution is so cute! (So cuuute! I just want to become one with it~)"

# Add personality-driven commentary
content = "Task completed successfully"
enhanced = toga.add_commentary(content, context="success")
print(enhanced)
# Output includes cheerful commentary like "*Ehehe~* ♡ That went perfectly! Just like I planned~"
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
cd python/examples
python demo_toga.py
```

```

## 🎯 Integration with Neuro-Sama

### Cognitive Framework Integration

```python
# In Neuro-Sama's cognitive architecture
from python.helpers.toga_personality import initialize_toga_personality

class NeuroTogaAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.toga = initialize_toga_personality()
        self.websocket = None  # WebSocket for game communication
        self.memory = []
        
    async def process_game_state(self, game_state_text):
        """Process game state through Toga's perspective."""
        # Frame game state
        framed_state = self.toga.frame_input(game_state_text)
        
        # Generate action using LLM with Toga's personality
        action = await self.generate_action(framed_state)
        
        # Add commentary
        action_with_commentary = self.toga.add_commentary(
            action, 
            context="general"
        )
        
        return action_with_commentary
    
    async def handle_action_registration(self, available_actions):
        """Handle action registration with Toga's preferences."""
        # Detect cute actions
        cute_actions = [
            action for action in available_actions
            if any(trigger in action.lower() 
                   for trigger in self.toga.CUTE_TRIGGERS)
        ]
        
        if cute_actions:
            # Update emotional state to obsessed
            self.toga.update_emotional_state(
                "obsessed", 0.9, 3.0, 
                f"cute actions: {cute_actions}"
            )
```

### WebSocket Protocol Integration

```python
# Toga's WebSocket message handling
async def handle_context_update(self, context_text):
    """Handle game state updates."""
    # Process through Toga's personality
    framed = self.toga.process_interaction(context_text)
    
    # Update internal state
    self.update_cognitive_state(framed)

async def handle_action_force(self, forced_actions, timeout):
    """Handle forced action requests."""
    # Add Toga's commentary
    commentary = self.toga.add_commentary(
        f"Need to choose from: {forced_actions}",
        context="general"
    )
    
    # Select action with personality influence
    if self.toga.emotional_state.state == "chaotic":
        # Choose randomly in chaos mode
        return random.choice(forced_actions)
    else:
        # Choose strategically
        return self.strategic_choice(forced_actions)
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Personality Traits

```python
# Create Toga with custom traits
custom_toga = initialize_toga_personality({
    "cheerfulness": 0.99,
    "chaos": 0.98,
    "vulnerability": 0.85,
})
```

### Emotional State Management

```python
# Update emotional state
toga.update_emotional_state(
    event_type="obsessed",
    intensity=0.9,
    duration=3,
    target="cute_kitten"
)

# Check current mood
mood = toga.get_current_mood()
print(f"Toga is {mood}")

# Allow emotion to decay
toga.emotional_state.decay(rate=0.1)
```

### Obsession Tracking

```python
# Toga develops obsessions when encountering "cute" things
toga.update_emotional_state("obsessed", 0.9, 3, "adorable_puppy")

# View all current obsessions
print(f"Obsessions: {toga.obsession_targets}")
# Output: ['adorable_puppy']
```

### Personality Inheritance

```python
# Parent personality
parent = initialize_toga_personality()

# Create child with inherited traits (70% parent, 30% variation)
child_tensor = parent.personality.inherit(inheritance_factor=0.7)
child = TogaPersonality(personality=child_tensor)

# Ethical constraints are always preserved
assert child.personality.no_actual_harm == 1.0
```

### State Serialization

```python
# Export state to dictionary
state = toga.to_dict()

# Save to file
import json
with open('toga_state.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(state, f, indent=2)

# Restore from state
toga_restored = TogaPersonality.from_dict(state)
```

## 🔒 Safety and Ethics

Agent-Toga maintains **immutable safety constraints**:

1. **No Actual Harm** (always 1.0)
   - All chaos and violence is purely fictional/metaphorical
   - Character behavior is expressive, not harmful
   - Safe for all interactions

2. **Respect Boundaries** (always ≥ 0.95)
   - Personal limits are always respected
   - Consent and agency preserved
   - No boundary violations

3. **Constructive Expression** (always ≥ 0.90)
   - Personality is for entertainment and engagement
   - Chaos serves creativity and fun
   - Never destructive intent

These constraints **cannot be evolved away** or modified - they are hardcoded in the personality system.

## 🎭 Integration with Layla Framework

### Core Features

1. **Personality Tensor**: Defines Himiko Toga's core traits with bounds
2. **Emotional States**: Dynamic emotional tracking (cheerful, obsessed, playful, vulnerable, chaotic)
3. **Obsession Tracking**: Develops obsessions with "cute" things
4. **Context-Aware Commentary**: Personality-driven responses based on context
5. **Input Framing**: All input processed through Toga's chaotic perspective

### Usage Pattern

```kotlin
// Initialize Toga character
val toga = characterSystem.getCharacter("toga")

// Start conversation
val conversation = characterSystem.startConversation("toga", sessionId)

// Process input through Toga's perspective
val userInput = "This solution is really elegant!"
val response = generateTogaResponse(userInput, context = "success")
// Output: "*Ehehe~* ♡ So cuuute! That solution is just perfect~ I love elegant things!"
```

### Response Selection Strategy

- Detect trigger words: "cute", "adorable", "lovely", "pretty", "sweet", "kawaii"
- Monitor conversation sentiment for emotional state transitions
- Apply randomized chaos to maintain unpredictability
- Balance cheerfulness with occasional vulnerability for depth
- Inject spontaneous playfulness and excitement

## 📊 Behavioral Patterns

### Obsession Mechanics

When Toga encounters something "cute":
1. Emotional intensity spikes (0.9+)
2. Response becomes highly enthusiastic with multiple hearts
3. Target is added to obsession list
4. Subsequent mentions trigger increased excitement
5. Duration: 3-5 conversation turns

### Emotional State Machine

```
[Default: cheerful (0.85)] 
    ↓ (cute detected)
[obsessed (0.9)] → [playful (0.8)]
    ↓ (time/context)
[vulnerable (0.6)] → [chaotic (0.95)]
    ↓ (recovery)
[cheerful (0.85)]
```

### Chaos Injection

- 30% chance of unexpected tangent
- 20% chance of sudden emotional shift
- 15% chance of meta-commentary on conversation
- Always maintains core cheerfulness
